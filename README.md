# Travel-Click

A convenient application that allows users to select one of thousands cities in the world, and see what is happening in that city and the country to which that city belongs just in one click. Users will also be able to select a date of their choice and see the top destinations (domestic/international) from that city.

**Motivation**

We wanted to create a mini travel application where users can see all information related to their favorite destination without having to go to many websites.

Login Screen/ Landing Page:

City map (which users can search for attractions/places, restaurants) and safety information.

By default, the Wikipedia Search Box will display the top 5 wiki pages that contain the city name. Users can also search for other pages via Search-Wikipedia box. If the pages exist on Wikipedia, it will return the links for those pages, and when users hover those links, they will display the page image and a description for that page (if applicable)

From here, users can select a date of their choice, and see the top 6 destinations out of their selected city/airport, and the links to the booking website
