# TravelPOCKET

A convenient application that allows users to select one of thousands cities in the world and see what's happening for that city in just one click. Users will also be able to select any date and see the top destinations (domestic/international) from that city.

**Motivation**

We wanted to create a simple but useful travel application where users can see all information related to their favorite destination without having to go to many websites.

Login Screen/ Landing Page:

This section will be kept at the top of the page to allow users select another destination.

City map (which users can search for attractions/places, restaurants) and safety information.

By default, the Wikipedia Search Box will display the top 5 wiki pages that contain the city name. Users can also search for other pages via Search-Wikipedia box. If the pages exist on Wikipedia, it will return the links for those pages, and when users hover those links, they will display the page image and a description for that page (if applicable)

From here, users can select a date of their choice, and see the top 6 destinations out of their selected city/airport, and the links to the booking website
